\section{Introduction}
The Lunar Hopper is a vertical take-off, vertical landing (VTVL) prototype for lunar exploration. The project began in 2010 and has achieved multiple milestones. The project is run as a partnership between the Faculty of Engineering and the Environment at the University of Southampton, and the Spaceflight Society, also at the University of Southampton. Each project group from the Faculty of Engineering and the Environment has been designated a successive Phase - the last Phase, Phase V, was run between October 2015 and June 2016. Following Phase V, the Spaceflight Society has contributed input to the project and is designated Phase VI.

There have been two `versions' of the Lunar Hopper, Mk I and Mk II. The Lunar Hopper Mk I was completed in Phase III and underwent an unsuccessful test flight. Phase IV then went on to work with a hybrid rocket development team to develop a new model, the Lunar Hopper Mk II, utilising the new engine. This model was designed and built during Phase IV but failed system flight-readiness tests on the day of attempted launch. 

Phase V went on to ruggedize the Mk II, and performed multiple improvements to Mk II that were passed on to Phase VI. The primary objective of Phase VI is to prepare for, and undertake, a test flight of the Mk II, whilst improving systems which are in need of critical modification. It is hoped that Phase VII, also of Spaceflight Society input, will then be able to perform further modifications and significantly improve the design and performance of the Hopper.

\subsection{Phase VI Objectives}

Alongside the main objective of readying the Lunar Hopper for flight, the secondary objectives of Phase VI were inherited from Phase V and are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Verify control system logic and control system operation
\item Modify and re-fit the propellant delivery system
\item Re-design and manufacture landing leg brackets
\item Ensure correct operation of the hybrid engine and attitude control thrusters
\item Optimise the landing leg system
\item Re-fit critical structural elements
\item Repair and improve the on-board electronics
\item Use the Lunar Hopper for outreach by performing demonstrations and generating multimedia for the University of Southampton

\end{enumerate}

\section{Funding and Budget}

Since Phase VI was being undertaken separately from the core education of the Aeronautics and Astronautics program, there was no funding available for use from the Faculty. In order to obtain the required funds for Phase VI, the Spaceflight Society submitted a bid to the Students' Union, SUSU, for the required funds; this was in exchange for the use of the Hopper as an outreach and education tool. The total allowance from SUSU was \pounds 500. 

\section{State of the Vehicle at Phase VI Start}

The Lunar Hopper had undergone large structural failure at the start of Phase VI; the three corner pieces that provide structural stability to the vehicle had de-laminated and failed, due to incorrect layering structure and improper material selection. To this end, the Hopper was structurally unsound and was required to be kept partially disassembled whilst it could not support its weight: two 1.6mm strips of aluminium were keeping the Hopper structurally supported. The landing leg system was also incorrectly dimensioned, with each strut being different lengths, as well as having improper clearance on the support shafts.

Further, the Hopper had many systems installed for appearances -- the Hopper was on display at the University's Design Show -- and the wiring, piping, landing legs, flange supports, and electronics, were all non-functional and had to be properly implemented.

The wiring in particular was of concern: 15 severed connections were present in the Arduino system; the relay board was disconnected, a pressure transducer cable had sheared, the communications board had been severed, the power lines severed, ACS thruster connections severed, and the vehicle also touted a broken electronics box. There had been no documentation of the wiring of the Hopper and, thus, there was a need to spend considerable time deciphering the required wiring layouts before testing could begin.

The ACTs had improperly sized and improperly finished nozzles, many of the 3D printed parts were unfit for purpose, and the project had managed to be iterated through six phases without a working SolidWorks model.

All of these issues had to be addressed through the course of Phase VI.
